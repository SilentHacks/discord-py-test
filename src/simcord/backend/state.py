"""The Backend: single in-memory source of truth for the virtual Discord.

REST handlers and gateway events are two projections of this one store: every
mutation that real Discord would announce over the gateway is broadcast to all
attached clients, so the bot's cache stays consistent with REST responses —
including for the bot's own actions.

The implementation lives in the ``ops`` subpackage: a shared
:class:`~simcord.backend.ops.base.BackendBase` kernel (constructor, clock, event
emitter, getters, ``compute_permissions``) plus one mixin per subsystem. This
module is the assembler — it composes those mixins into the concrete ``Backend``
and re-exports the names other modules import from here.
